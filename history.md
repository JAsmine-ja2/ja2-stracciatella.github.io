# Timeline of The Jagged Alliance series

Okay, so you've played the hell out of *Jagged Alliance 2* and it's add-on, *Unfinished Business*. You've at least heard of or seen some screenshots of *Jagged Alliance 1*. Finally, you've seen this game called *Jagged Alliance: Flashback*, and thought "meh".
